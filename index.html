         About me:
         </h2>
         <h3>
         <p>
         I’m a tech enthusiast with a strong passion for Linux and programming, always eager to dive into new projects and challenges. Whether I’m tinkering with code or optimizing my system, I find joy in solving problems and learning new skills. When I'm not coding, you’ll often find me immersed in the worlds of manga and light novels, with a special fondness for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocchi_the_Rock%21" target="_blank" title="my belove title">Bocchi the Rock</a>. The series resonates with me for its unique storytelling and relatable characters, capturing the highs and lows of pursuing a passion for music. It has truly inspired my own guitar journey, motivating me to learn and improve my skills. Other favorites include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieren" target="_blank" title="Himmel when">Frieren: Beyond Journey End</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaguya-sama:_Love_Is_War" target="_blank" title="my first anime">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a>, each offering captivating narratives that inspire me in different ways. Other honor mentions that I also love but not make into top three are all mangas by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatsuki_Fujimoto" target="_blank" title="anidrugdealer">Tatsuki Fujimoto</a>, movies that are directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makoto_Shinkai" target="_blank" title="beautifulanime">Shinkai Makoto</a>, and many more

         Guitar playing has become a significant part of my life, and I’m currently learning to play while saving up for a <a href="https://jp.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/guitars_basses/el_guitars/pacifica/index.html" target="_blank" title="mydreamguitar">Yamaha Pacifica</a> (still haven't decided a specific one), which I’m excited because it will be my first electric guitar ever. Bocchi the Rock has played a crucial role in my musical journey, pushing me to embrace my love for the guitar and express myself through music. The way the characters navigate their musical aspirations inspires me to dedicate time to practice and explore different styles. Each new chord I learn feels like a step closer to creating the music I love.

         My passion for guitar is deeply intertwined with my love for J-rock. The energy and emotion in J-rock music resonate with me, driving my desire to master the instrument. Bands like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@akgSMEJ" target="_blank" title="band">Asian Kung-Fu Generation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ONEOKROCK" target="_blank" title="Osu">One OK Rock</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TUYU_official" target="_blank" title="whyPUSU???">TUYU (rip)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6IhDHJbJUoRJGUPnlh5GRQ" target="_blank" title="ILY">Kessoku band</a>,... have become my go-to inspirations. Their intricate guitar work and powerful melodies motivate me to improve my skills and experiment with different techniques. Whether it’s playing along with my favorite tracks or crafting my own riffs, J-rock fuels my creativity and passion for music.
         </p>
         <p>
         I find myself diving into the lyrical themes of J-rock, which often explore complex emotions and stories. This connection enhances my playing, as I aim to infuse my own feelings into the music I create. With every practice session, I can feel my connection to the guitar deepening, and I can’t wait to share my own musical journey influenced by the vibrant world of J-rock!
         </p>
         <p>
         Equally important to me is my enthusiasm for <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source" target="_blank" title="commiestuffs">open source software</a>. I truly believe in the power of collaboration and community that open source embodies. Contributing to projects, whether it’s fixing bugs, developing new features, or helping others with their coding challenges, gives me a sense of fulfillment and connection to a larger purpose. The open source movement champions transparency, accessibility, and the idea that anyone can contribute, which resonates with my own values.
         </p>
         <p>
         Using open source tools, like <a href="https://ultramarine-linux.org/" target="_blank" title="distro">Ultramarine Linux</a> with <a href="https://kde.org/" target="_blank" title="Kde">Kde</a>, <a href="https://www.zsh.org/" target="_blank" title="shell">Zsh</a>, <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" title="">Rustlang</a> and right now the text editor I'm using right now; <a href="https://apps.kde.org/kate/" target="_blank" title="ide">Kate</a>, enhances my programming experience, allowing me to customize my environment and learn from a community of like-minded individuals. I love exploring new projects, sharing my own, and being part of a movement that prioritizes knowledge-sharing and innovation. This passion for open source not only fuels my tech pursuits but also influences my approach to music—much like J-rock, it’s about collaboration, expression, and the joy of creating something meaningful together.
         </p>
         <p>
         Balancing my interests in tech, music, and literature keeps me inspired and motivated as I navigate through life. I’m always on the lookout for new experiences and ideas to expand my horizons, whether it’s through learning, playing music, or exploring new stories.
