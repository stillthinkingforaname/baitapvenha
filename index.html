    about:programing. I'm an <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source" target="_blank" title="commiestuff">open-source</a> software lover. I truly believe in the power of the community and what we can do. Seeing all open source communitys growing and working plant in me a hope for a unity world without all of this current mess.

    about:guitar. While we are still in this topic, why don't me talk more about my guitar addiction? I have an accoustic guitar at home and is my main way to practic now. But I'm also interested in electric guitar thanks to Bocchi and Kita. I'm now saving for a <a href="https://jp.yamaha.com/products/musical_instruments/guitars_basses/el_guitars/pacifica/index.html" target="_blank" title="mydreamguitar">Yamaha Pacifica</a> and I'm very excited for it since this will be the first time I buy a guitar, an electric one. Playing guitar is probally my favorite way to combat with my stress along side listening to music. Everytime when I learn to play a new song or found a way to improve my playing skill, it make me very happy. Sadly my wrist is broke now so I have to stop playing for sometime.

    about:music. I'm a big fan of Jrock. Many bands like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ONEOKROCK" target="_blank" title="Osu">ONE OK ROCK</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TUYU_official" target="_blank" title="PUSUwhy?????">TUYU</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@akgSMEJ" target="_blank" title="deepmeaning">ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6IhDHJbJUoRJGUPnlh5GRQ" target="_blank" title="ily">Kessoku band</a> and many more is alway in my daily song playlist. Everything from the lyrics, melodies, instruments play styles (especially guitar) and the vibe encourage my to improve my skills constanly. Aside from Jrock, I also enjoy all kind of music from all over the world. Music is truly a non barrier language.
